# Vinyl Keeper

This project was inspired by [Charlie Murphey's](https://github.com/murphey37) front end capstone project for [Nashville Software School](https://github.com/nashville-software-school).

There is no reason for creating this application other than for pure enjoyment and some CSS practice. It's not my _best_ work, but I am pretty proud of it.
